# A simple Calculator in JAVA using NETBEANS
Following a tutorial online I created a simple Calculator App.


## How to run
Make sure you have NetBeans and Java installed
Open NetBeans and open the project and press Clean and Build Project(hammer and broom icon), this will create your Calculator.jar in the dist folder. After this if you click Run Project(green arrow) and that will run your app in your desktop.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tamasmagyarhunor88/Calculator.git
$ cd Calculator
$ open dist/Calculator.jar # after you pressed build in NetBeans, you can use this line to open the app
```
